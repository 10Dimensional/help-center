With two-factor authentication (2fa) enabled, you'll be asked to provide an authentication code as 
well as your password, when you access the Replicated vendor portal. Replicated utilizes the open 
algorithm known as the Time-based One-time Password 
([TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)) which is specified by 
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) under [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

To enable two-factor authentication:

- Log in to Replicated and visit the [account settings page](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings).
- Click on the “Turn on Two-Factor Auth” button
- Enter your password to get to the two-factor configuration view.
- Open a supported two-factor authentication app on your device (we suggest Google Authenticator).
- Scan the QR code or enter the alphanumeric code into the app.
- Enter the generated code in the form.

## Save the recovery codes

You will be presented with an option to download a set of recovery codes. These codes can be used any 
time (one time per code), in case you lose your device. It's important to save these codes in a secure 
location.

## Log out

Try it out. Log out of your account and log back in. You will be prompted to enter a one-time code 
generated by the supported application.
