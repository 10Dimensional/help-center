The Customers Dashboard of Replicated is where you create, manage, and report on customers and their licenses. Customers are created within the context of a single application. If you are deploying multiple applications through Replicated, you will need one customer per application
 even if they are the same.

To access the Customer Dashboard from the vendor portal, first make sure you are using the right application by choosing it in the dropdown and selecting it. From there, navigate to the customer dashboard via the Customers navigation item on the left.

The first time you visit the Customer Dashboard, you are prompted to create your first customer. Click the button to create a customer and issue a license.

> Note that to create a customer, you will need to create your first release and promote it to a channel. See [the guides](/guides) to pick an application release guide specific for the scheduler you want to use.
