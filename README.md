## Local development

Before you are able to run this locally you need to have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) on your machine. If you already have Hugo installed, make sure you [have the latest version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo)

1. Clone this repo and create a new directory called `themes` at the root of the project.

2. Navigate to the newly created `themes` directory and clone the [replicated-docs-theme](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-docs-theme) into it.

3. Navigate back to the root of the project and run `hugo` to build the project, then `hugo serve` to create the local server.

4. In your browser navigate to `localhost:1313`
